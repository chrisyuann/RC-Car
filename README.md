# Remote Controlled Self-Designed Car

## Intro
I want to create a remote controlled car intended for audiences of kids and teenagers. The goal is to make the car fun and easy to drive and control with a remote. I want my car to be unique, and I'm coming up with original ideas to create the main aspects of the car: the steering and differential. For the steering, I will create a belt-and-pulley system operated by a servo, rotating a four-bar linkage system. The car will be a rear wheel differential, preventing slippage when the car is making sharp turns.

## Research
I researched about the differential. The basics include a pinion gear that rotates the sun gear, rotating the differential housing. The inner gears rotate along with the housing. When the car is turning, the differential allows the wheels to spin at different speeds with two different D-shafts.

The steering system also required research. The most common type of steering is the rack and pinion. This design is used on the majority of produced cars, which solidifies reliability. I looked at other steering systems as well. The crank and slider system also turns the wheels and is used in some vehicles. However, I decided to build my own, using a belt-and-pulley that rotates the wheels.
